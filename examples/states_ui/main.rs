///
/// Switch from the 'Welcome' Screen to the 'Menu' Screen.
/// From the 'Menu', switch to either 'Credits' (from which you can only switch back) or to 'Game'.
/// From 'Game', you can enter the 'Pause' menu.
/// Here you can select to resume (go back to 'Game'), exit to menu (go to 'Menu') or exit (quit).
///
/// During the 'Pause' menu, the 'Game' is paused accordingly.
