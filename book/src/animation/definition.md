# Definition

Animations can be defined for objects made of a single entity, or complex objects made up of multiple entities.

Right now we do not have a tutorial for defining an animation from scratch, but take a look at the following resources to get an idea of how to write one:

- [animation example][ex_ani]
- [gltf example][ex_gltf]
- [sprite animation example][ex_sprite]
- [API docs][api]
