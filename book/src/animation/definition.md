# Definition

Animations can be defined for objects made of a single entity, or complex objects made up of multiple entities.

Right now we do not have a tutorial for defining an animation from scratch, but take a look at the following resources to get an idea of how to write one:

* [animation example][ex_ani]
* [gltf example][ex_gltf]
* [API docs][api]

[api]: https://docs.rs/amethyst_animation
