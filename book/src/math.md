# Math

Amethyst uses [nalgebra][na] under the hood as its math library and it's
exposed for us to use as `amethyst::core::nalgebra`. As the documentation for
nalgebra is already very good, we won't go into detail here about how to use it.
Instead we'll redirect you to the excellent [nalgebra website][na] where you can
find the documentation for nalgebra along with excellent examples and quick
references.
