# Math

Amethyst uses [nalgebra][na] under the hood as its math library and it is
re-exported for use under the `amethyst::core::nalgebra` namespace. As the
documentation for nalgebra is already very good, we will not go into detail
here about how to use it. Instead we will redirect you to the excellent
[nalgebra website][na] where you can find the documentation for nalgebra
along with excellent examples and quick references.
