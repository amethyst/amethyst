# Adding a Ball Config

For simplicity, we will wrap all of our Config objects into a single `PongConfig` object backed by a single
`config.ron` file, but know that you can just as easily keep them in separate files and read from each file
separately.

To prepare for our `BallConfig`, add the following line to the top of `config.rs`:

```rust,ignore
use amethyst::core::nalgebra::Vector2;
```

The `BallConfig` will replace the `BALL_VELOCITY_X`, `BALL_VELOCITY_Y`, `BALL_RADIUS`, and `BALL_COLOR`
variables. We'll use a [`Vector2`][vec2] to store the velocity for simplicity and to demonstrate how to add
a non-trivial data type to a RON file. The `BALL_COLOR` was originally an array, but [Serde][serde] and RON
handle arrays as tuples, so it will read in a tuple and convert the colour values to an array if needed by a
particular function (e.g., in `pong.rs`).

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct BallConfig {
    pub velocity: Vector2<f32>,
    pub radius: f32,
    pub colour: (f32, f32, f32, f32),
}
```

We'll also add the `Default` trait to this config that will match what the full example uses.

```rust,ignore
impl Default for BallConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        BallConfig {
            velocity: Vector2::new(75.0, 50.0),
            radius: 2.5,
            colour: (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
        }
    }
}
```

Still in `config.rs`, add the following structure definition at the very bottom. This structure will be
backed by the whole `config.ron` file.

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Debug, Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct PongConfig {
    pub arena: ArenaConfig,
    pub ball: BallConfig,
}
```

## Replacing Ball Constants

Now we need to replace our usage of the `BALL_*` constants with our new `BallConfig`.

We use these values in `pong.rs` in the `initialise_ball()` function, so the substitution is even simpler than
the `ArenaConfig`.

In `pong.rs`, underneath our loading of the `ArenaConfig`, add the following lines

```rust,ignore
let (velocity_x, velocity_y, radius, colour) = {
    let config = world.read_resource::<BallConfig>();
    let c: [f32; 4] = [
        config.colour.0,
        config.colour.1,
        config.colour.2,
        config.colour.3,
    ];
    (config.velocity.x, config.velocity.y, config.radius, c)
};
```

Our functions expect a `[f32; 4]` array, so we had to convert the tuple to an array. This is relatively
simple to do, but for more complex arrays it might be worth it to add a function to the `impl BallConfig` to
avoid duplicating this effort.

Now, within the `initialise_ball` function, replace `BALL_VELOCITY_X` with `velocity_x`, `BALL_VELOCITY_Y`
with `velocity_y`, `BALL_RADIUS` with `radius`, and `BALL_COLOR` with `color`.

## Modifying the initialisation

Now we will modify our application initialisation. We don't want everyone to always access all the config files, so we need to
add each resource separately so systems can use only what they want.

First, we need to change what `main.rs` is using. Change

```rust,ignore
use crate::config::ArenaConfig;
```

to

```rust,ignore
use crate::config::PongConfig;
```

Now, modify the `run()` function, from

```rust,ignore
let arena_config = ArenaConfig::load(&config);
[..]
    .with_resource(arena_config)
    .with_bundle(PongBundle::default())?
```

to

```rust,ignore
let pong_config = PongConfig::load(&config);
[..]
    .with_resource(pong_config.arena)
    .with_resource(pong_config.ball)
    .with_bundle(PongBundle::default())?
```

## Adding the BallConfig to `config.ron`

Now we need to modify our configuration file to allow multiple structures to be included. This is actually
very easy with RON; we just add an additional level of nesting.

```ignore
(
    arena: (
        height: 100.0,
        width: 100.0,
    ),
    ball: (
        velocity: Vector2(
            x: 75.0,
            y: 50.0,
        ),
        radius: 2.5,
        color: (1.0, 0.647, 0.0, 1.0),
    ),
)
```

This configuration sets the ball to be orange, while retaining the same size and velocity as the original
example.
