# Concepts behind Amethyst

Amethyst uses quite a few concepts that you might not be familiar with.
This section of the book is dedicated to explain what they are, how they work and
how they relate to each other.

If you are a practical person and want to get quickly into the code, you can skip to the [pong tutorial][pt]
section of the book, which is focused on practice.

If you don't understand how something works in amethyst, knowing the concepts presented here will help make sense of how some implements are made.
