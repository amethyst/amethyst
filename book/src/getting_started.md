# Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a working Amethyst game development
environment. Then we'll test this environment by compiling a simple "Hello,
World" application.

Amethyst should compile hassle-free on any platform properly supported by the
Rust compiler. Here are the system requirements (they're pretty modest):

* Minimum:
  * CPU: 1GHz, the more cores the better
  * RAM: 512 MiB
  * HDD: 17 MiB free disk space
  * OS: Windows Vista and newer, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X
  * Rust: Nightly (1.6.0 or newer)
* Renderer Backends:
  * OpenGL 4.0 or newer

## Setting Up

> Note: This guide assumes you have nightly Rust and Cargo installed, and also
> have a working Internet connection.
> Please take care of these prerequisites first before proceeding.
> See [rustup][ru] for handling multiple rust toolchains.

To create a new project, it's recommended to use our project template as described in the [next section](./getting_started/automatic_setup.html).
