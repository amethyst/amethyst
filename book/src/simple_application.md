# [DRAFT] Writing a Simple Application

In this section, I'll walk you through implementing a simple 3D Pong clone using
Amethyst. You will learn a bit more about game states and also basic
entity-component-system game design and we will apply those concepts and build
a little toy game. Hopefully by the end of this section, you will have gotten
the hang of working with Amethyst.
