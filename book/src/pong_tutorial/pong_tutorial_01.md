# Opening (and closing!) a window

Let's start a new project:

`amethyst new pong`

If you run this project with `cargo run`, you'll end up with a window titled 
"pong" that renders a really delightful shade of green. Press `Esc` to quit. If 
you're having trouble getting the project to run, double check the 
[Getting Started][gs] guide.

We've opened and closed a window, so we're basically done! But let's write this 
functionality ourselves so we're sure we know what's going on.

In `src` there's a `main.rs` file. Delete everything, then add these imports:

```rust,ignore
extern crate amethyst;

use amethyst::Result;
use amethyst::prelude::*;
use amethyst::renderer::{DisplayConfig, DrawFlat, Event, KeyboardInput,
                         Pipeline, PosTex, RenderBundle, RenderSystem,
                         Stage, VirtualKeyCode, WindowEvent};
```

We'll be learning more about these as we go through this tutorial. The prelude 
includes the basic (and most important) types like `Application`, `World`, and 
`State`.

Now we create our core game struct:

```rust,ignore
struct Pong; 
```

We'll be implementing the [`State`][st] trait on this struct, which is used by 
Amethyst's state machine to start, stop, and update the game. But for now we'll 
just implement one method: 

```rust,ignore
impl State for Pong {
    fn handle_event(&mut self, _: &mut World, event: Event) -> Trans {
        match event {
            Event::WindowEvent { event, .. } => match event {
                WindowEvent::KeyboardInput {
                    input:
                        KeyboardInput {
                            virtual_keycode: Some(VirtualKeyCode::Escape),
                            ..
                        },
                    ..
                } => Trans::Quit,
                _ => Trans::None,
            },
            _ => Trans::None,
        }
    }
}
```

The `handle_event` method is executed on every frame before updating, and it's 
used to react to events. It returns a `Trans`, which is an enum of state machine 
transitions. In this case, we're watching for the Escape keycode from the 
Window. If we receive it, we'll return `Trans::Quit` which will be used to clean 
up the `State` and close the application. All other keyboard input is ignored 
for now.

Now that we know we can quit, let's add some code to actually get things 
started! We'll use a `run()` function, which returns a Result and thus 
allows us to use `?`.

```rust,ignore
fn run() -> Result<()> {

    //We'll put the rest of the code here

    Ok(())
}
```

Inside run() we first define a path for our display_config.ron file and load it.

```rust,ignore
let path = "./resources/display_config.ron";

let config = DisplayConfig::load(&path);
```

This .ron file was automatically generated by `amethyst new`. If you didn't use 
`amethyst new`, now would be a good time to create this config file inside a 
folder named resources. If you already have this file, we have some changes to 
make, anyway:

```rust,ignore
(
  title: "Pong!",
  dimensions: Some((500, 500)),
  max_dimensions: None,
  min_dimensions: None,
  fullscreen: false,
  multisampling: 1,
  visibility: true,
  vsync: true,
)
```

This will set the default window dimensions to 500 x 500, and make the title bar 
say "Pong!" instead of the sad, lowercase default of "pong".

Now, back inside our run() function in main.rs, let's copy and paste some 
rendering code so we can keep moving. We'll cover rendering in more depth later 
in this tutorial.

```rust,ignore
let pipe = Pipeline::build().with_stage(
    Stage::with_backbuffer()
        .clear_target([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], 1.0)
        .with_pass(DrawFlat::<PosTex>::new()),
);
```

The important thing to know right now is that this renders a black background. 
If you want a different color you can tweak the RGBA values inside the 
`.clear_target` method. Values range from 0.0 to 1.0, so to get that cool green 
color we started with back, for instance, you can try 
`[0.00196, 0.23726, 0.21765, 1.0]`.

Now let's pack everything up and run it:

```rust,ignore
let mut game = Application::build("./", Pong)?
    .with_bundle(RenderBundle::new())?
    .with_local(RenderSystem::build(pipe, Some(config))?)
    .build()?;

Ok(game.run())
```

We've discovered Amethyst's root object: [Application][ap]. It binds the OS 
event loop, state machines, timers and other core components in a central place. 
Here we're creating a new `RenderBundle`, adding the `Pipeline` we created, 
along with our config, and building.

Then we call `.run()` on `game` which begins the gameloop. The game will 
continue to run until our `State` returns `Trans::Quit`, or when all states have 
been popped off the state machine's stack.

Now all that's left is to write a `main()` function to call our `run()` 
function:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    if let Err(e) = run() {
        println!("Error occurred during game execution: {}", e);
        ::std::process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

Success! Now we should be able to compile and run this code and get a window. 
It should look something like this:
