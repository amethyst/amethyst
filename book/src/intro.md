# The Amethyst Engine

> Note: This project is a *work in progress* and is very incomplete. Pardon the
> dust!

Howdy! This book will teach you everything you need to know about building video
games and interactive simulations with the Amethyst game engine. This engine is
written entirely in [Rust][rs], a safe and fast systems programming language,
and sports a clean and modern design. More correctly, though, Amethyst is
actually a suite of separate libraries and tools that collectively make up a
game engine.

[rs]: https://www.rust-lang.org/

Amethyst is free and open source software, distributed under a dual license of [MIT][ml]
and [Apache][al]. This means that the engine is given to you at no cost
and its source code is completely yours to tinker with. The code is available on
[GitHub][am]. Contributions and feature requests are welcome!

This book is split into seven sections. This page is the first. The others are:

* [Getting Started][gs] – Prepare your computer for Amethyst development.
* [A Simple Application][sa] – Build a basic pong game in Rust.
* Effective Amethyst – Learn how to write complex games and applications.
* Scripting – Jump into scripted development with [Ruby][rb].
* [Glossary][gl] - Defines special terms used throughout the book.
* Bibliography – Read the works that influenced the design.
