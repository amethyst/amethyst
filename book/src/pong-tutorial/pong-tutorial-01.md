# Opening (and closing!) a window

Let's start a new project:

`amethyst new pong`

If you run this project with `cargo run`, you'll end up with a window titled
"pong" that renders a really delightful shade of green. Press `Esc` to quit. If
you're having trouble getting the project to run, double check the
[Getting Started][gs] guide.

We've opened and closed a window, so we're basically done! But let's write this
functionality ourselves so we're sure we know what's going on.

In `src` there's a `main.rs` file. Delete everything, then add these imports:

```rust,ignore
extern crate amethyst;

use amethyst::prelude::*;
use amethyst::input::{is_close_requested, is_key_down};
use amethyst::renderer::{DisplayConfig, DrawFlat, Event, KeyboardInput,
                         Pipeline, PosTex, RenderBundle, Stage,
                         VirtualKeyCode, WindowEvent};
```

We'll be learning more about these as we go through this tutorial. The prelude
includes the basic (and most important) types like `Application`, `World`, and
`State`.

Now we create our core game struct:

```rust,ignore
pub struct Pong;
```

We'll be implementing the [`State`][st] trait on this struct, which is used by
Amethyst's state machine to start, stop, and update the game. But for now we'll
just implement two methods:

```rust,ignore
impl<'a, 'b> State<GameData<'a, 'b>> for Pong {
    fn handle_event(&mut self, _: StateData<GameData>, event: Event) -> Trans<GameData<'a, 'b>> {
        if is_close_requested(&event) || is_key_down(&event, VirtualKeyCode::Escape) {
            Trans::Quit
        } else {
            Trans::None
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, data: StateData<GameData>) -> Trans<GameData<'a, 'b>> {
        data.data.update(&data.world);
        Trans::None
    }
}
```

The `handle_event` method is executed for every event before updating, and it's
used to react to events. It returns a `Trans`, which is an enum of state machine
transitions. In this case, we're watching for the Escape keycode, and the
`CloseRequested` event from the Window. If we receive it, we'll return
`Trans::Quit` which will be used to clean up the `State` and close the application.
All other keyboard input is ignored for now.

The `update` method is executed after events have happened.  In this instance
we're just using it to execute our dispatcher.  More on that later.

Now that we know we can quit, let's add some code to actually get things
started! We'll start with our `main` function, and we'll have it return a
`Result` so that we can use `?`. This will allow us to automatically exit
if any errors occur during setup.

```rust,ignore
fn main() -> amethyst::Result<()> {

    // We'll put the rest of the code here.

    Ok(())
}
```

Inside `main()` we first start the default amethyst logger so we can see
errors, warnings and debug messages while the program is running.

```rust,ignore
amethyst::start_logger(Default::default());
```

After the logger is started, we define a path for our display_config.ron file
and load it.

```rust,ignore
let path = "./resources/display_config.ron";

let config = DisplayConfig::load(&path);
```

This .ron file was automatically generated by `amethyst new`. If you didn't use
`amethyst new`, now would be a good time to create this config file inside a
folder named resources. If you already have this file, we have some changes to
make, anyway:

```rust,ignore
(
  title: "Pong!",
  dimensions: Some((500, 500)),
  max_dimensions: None,
  min_dimensions: None,
  fullscreen: false,
  multisampling: 0,
  visibility: true,
  vsync: true,
)
```

This will set the default window dimensions to 500 x 500, and make the title bar
say "Pong!" instead of the sad, lowercase default of "pong".

Now, back inside our `main()` function in main.rs, let's copy and paste some
rendering code so we can keep moving. We'll cover rendering in more depth later
in this tutorial.

```rust,ignore
let pipe = Pipeline::build().with_stage(
    Stage::with_backbuffer()
        .clear_target([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], 1.0)
        .with_pass(DrawFlat::<PosTex>::new()),
);
```

The important thing to know right now is that this renders a black background.
If you want a different color you can tweak the RGBA values inside the
`.clear_target` method. Values range from 0.0 to 1.0, so to get that cool green
color we started with back, for instance, you can try
`[0.00196, 0.23726, 0.21765, 1.0]`.

Now let's pack everything up and run it:

```rust,ignore
let game_data = GameDataBuilder::default().with_bundle(RenderBundle::new(pipe, Some(config)))?;
let mut game = Application::new("./", Pong, game_data)?;
game.run();
Ok(())
```

We've discovered Amethyst's root object: [Application][ap]. It binds the OS
event loop, state machines, timers and other core components in a central place.
Here we're creating a new `RenderBundle`, adding the `Pipeline` we created,
along with our config, and building. There is also a helper function 
`with_basic_renderer` on `GameDataBuilder` that you can use to create your 
`Pipeline` and `RenderBundle`, that performs most of the actions above. In the
full `pong` example in the `Amethyst` repository that function is used instead.

Then we call `.run()` on `game` which begins the gameloop. The game will
continue to run until our `State` returns `Trans::Quit`, or when all states have
been popped off the state machine's stack.

Finally, let's create a `texture` folder in the root of the project. This
will contain the [spritesheet texture][ss] `pong_spritesheet.png` we will need
to render the elements of the game.

Success! Now we should be able to compile and run this code and get a window.
It should look something like this:
